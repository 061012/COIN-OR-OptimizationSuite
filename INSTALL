This CoinAll package contains most (or all) of the COIN-OR projects.

By default, a configuration will compile all projects, that follow the
COIN-OR build system (using the GNU autotools).

If you want to exclude projects from the configuration and
compilation, you can do so by setting the COIN_SKIP_PROJECTS variable
to a space-separated list of the project directory names, such as

./configure [...]  COIN_SKIP_PROJECTS='Cbc Clp'

A few notes:

- If you want to compile Ipopt, you need to make sure that Blas,
  Lapack and certain packages from the Harwell subroutine library are
  available (see the INSTALL.* files in ThirdParty/*).

Below are the standard COIN-OR installation procedures:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are for UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Cygwin
and MSys) only.  If Microsoft Developer Studio projects are
maintained for this package, you can find instructions at

**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the CoinAll package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "COIN-CoinAll", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CoinAll/trunk Coin-CoinAll

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/CoinAll and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip CoinAll_2006Jun07.tgz
   tar xvf CoinAll_2006Jun07.tar

   (Here "2006Jun07" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
Coin-CoinAll or CoinAll_2006Jun07).  Then you type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of CoinAll successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code in the projects works, you can type

   make tests

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples for a Project Prjct in 

   Prjct/examples/

subdirectory (for those, that provide examples), see also the
information at
